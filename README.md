# Themes
It's hard to satisfy everyone with a single design, that's why at Pixure, we want our users to be able to design their own themes and submit them to us.

Fork this repo and submit a pull request to us for your theme to be added to our platform :)

Requirements
------------
* Follows our template structure (we're still preparing, it'll be available soon)
* Follows and supports Bootstrap Framework (http://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)

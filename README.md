# Update
As of 2/19/18, we've integrated a few different layouts (3) for users to choose from. We want Pixure to have a set color palette that users would be able to identify us with (variations of purple).

As of now, we're discontinuing the "custom theme design" aspect of the platform, and incline on replacing it with a "custom template option" enabling users to create different layouts and looks without changing the color scheme.


# Themes
It's hard to satisfy everyone with a single design, that's why at Pixure, we want our users to be able to design their own themes and submit them to us.

Fork this repo and submit a pull request to us for your theme to be added to our platform :)

Requirements
------------
* Follows our template structure (we're still preparing, it'll be available soon)
* Follows and supports Bootstrap Framework (http://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)
